# Oop
--> Object Oriented Programming is a programming 'philosophy' that relies on the concept of classes and objects which is used to structure program into simple, reusable pieces 
of code called as classes. Classes are used to create individual instances of objects. 
* # Class 
--> A blueprint of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.
* # Object
--> (Instance of a class) It is a self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.
* # Methods -->
It is block of code which only runs when it is called.
* # Attributes -->
Attributes are the information that is stored. 
* # Inheritance -->
It is a feature that represents the relationship between different classes. (Using Attributes/properties of parent classes in child classes) ("extends" keyword) 
* # Access Modifiers: 
--> The accessibility of a field/attributes/properties, method, constructor, or class.
|   |  Class |Package | Sub-Class | World |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Public    | YES  | YES | YES  | YES  |
| Private   | YES  | NO  |  NO  |  NO  |
| Protected |  YES | YES |  YES |  NO  |
| None      |  YES | YES |  No  |  NO  |

* # Encapsulation -->
The process of combining elements to create a new entity. A procedure is a type of encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions.
Information hiding: The process of hiding details of an object or function. Information hiding is a powerful programming technique because it reduces complexity.
* # Abstraction -->
Exposing high level public methods for accessing an object.
* # Polymorphism -->
A programming languageâ€™s ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
